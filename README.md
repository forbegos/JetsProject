## Jets Project

### Skill Distillery Week 3 - Weekend Homework

This program simulates an airfield of airplanes with engine type Jet.  Planes in the airfield can be cargo carriers or fighter jets.  Further implementation can allow for including other types of planes. 
The program reads a comma separated values (csv) file from the hard drive with a pre-populated list of cargo planes and fighter jets and includes, for each, its speed, range, model and price.

The program provide the following options for the handling of information:

+ Populate the airfield
+ Add planes to the airfield
+ Remove planes from the airfield
+ Display the planes in the airfield
+ Find the fastest plane and the planed with the longest range
+ Load cargo on all the cargo planes
+ Initiate a dogfight with the fighter jets 

#### Technologies Used

+ Object oriented programming
+ Abstract classes
+ Interfaces
+ Exceptions
+ Java
+ Eclipse IDE

#### Lessons Learned

+ It is better and more flexible to use Lists instead of arrays[].
+ All classes should have a no-args constructor for ease of instantiating new instances
+ The use of super classes
+ Reading from a file and handling the information obtained
+ How to correctly use exceptions for input situations
